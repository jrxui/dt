## [Read an in-depth tutorial on how to use this here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2).

This is a fork of https://github.com/koenrh/delete-tweets specifically for my tutorial.

I made his library slightly easier to use for non-Python developers by removing the need for environment variables.

I do not plan to maintain this fork. If you want to contribute to this project, please contribute to @koenrh's repo instead.
